# BotKit
Building blocks for building bots.

BotKit is a java spring-boot application _(inspired by [Howdyai's Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit))_ to make
Slack _(Facebook and Twitter coming soon)_ bots in minutes. It provides all
the boilerplate code needed so that you can make your bot live right away.

## SlackBot

### Getting started
Running your SlackBot is just 3 easy steps:
1. Get your slack token from .
2. Paste the token in [resources/application.properties](/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.
3. Run the application by clicking `Run` in your IDE or via commandline `$ mvn spring-boot:run`.

You can now start talking with your bot ;)
