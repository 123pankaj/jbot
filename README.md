# BotKit
Building blocks for building bots.

BotKit is a java spring-boot application _(inspired by [Howdyai's Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit))_ to make
Slack _(Facebook and Twitter coming soon)_ bots in minutes. It provides all
the boilerplate code needed so that you can make your bot live right away.

## SlackBot

### Getting started
Running your SlackBot is just 4 easy steps:  
1. Clone this project `git clone git@github.com:ramswaroop/botkit.git`.  
2. [Create a slack bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) and get your slack token.  
3. Paste the token in [application.properties](/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.  
4. Run the application by running `BotKitApplication` in your IDE or via commandline `$ mvn spring-boot:run`.  

You can now start talking with your bot ;)
